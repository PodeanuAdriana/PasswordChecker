This project was carried out to verify the security of users' passwords and to provide a useful response for improving them. 
It is designed using multiple password verification algorithms, such as checking the length of the password, whether it contains special characters, numbers, uppercase, or lowercase letters.
In this project, I used the Python programming language and the os and csv modules to import and read data from a CSV file.
Additionally, I utilized the re module for Regex expressions to more easily identify the special characters found in the composition of passwords.
Another important aspect of this project is the division of tasks into functions, making it easier to adapt the code for future improvements and to read data from a CSV file. 
This allows for testing multiple entries at once.
